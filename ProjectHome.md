The tWSDL Project provides a Tcl API for building and accessing Web Services.

The purpose of a Web Service is to expose an internal functionality or application in a programming language neutral and machine readable format to external clients.

As the name implies, the tWSDL Project uses the Web Services Description Language (WSDL 1.1) to define, impliment and access Web Services. More specifically, tWSDL follows the interoperability guidelines found in the WS-I Basic Profile.

The tWSDL Project provides substantial new functionality to Web Service developers.
